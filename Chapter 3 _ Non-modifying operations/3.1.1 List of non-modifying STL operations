3.1.1 List of non-modifying STL operations

Non-modifying means that these operations do not change the elements of the collection, or the collection itself. 
Generally, this is true, but regardless of the name, it’s possible to change the elements when some of these functions are called – especially the for_each algorithm.
But using non-modifying operations to change the values of the collection means going against good programming practices.
So, the best advice is: stick to what the designers of the STL think is right.
